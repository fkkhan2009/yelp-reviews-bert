# **Sentiment Analysis on Yelp Open Dataset**

## **Abstract**
####In this project I made use of a pre-trained BERT model from TensorFlow Hub which was subsequently fine-tuned on Yelp's Open dataset to identify the sentiment behind any review. Though the model was trained on restaurant reviews, it works well on other texts as well.

## Status
#### The project was built entirely in Python with TensorFlow and Keras being used for model training and evaluation.
#### I used Streamlit to make a web app for this project and FastAPI for the backend application.

#### The aim now is to expand the scale of my model by deploying it on a cloud platform.
